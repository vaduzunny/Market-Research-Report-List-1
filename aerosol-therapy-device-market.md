<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aerosol Therapy Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metered Dose Inhalers (MDIs)</li><li>Dry Powder Inhalers (DPIs)</li><li>Nebulizers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aerosol therapy device market includes three main types: Metered Dose Inhalers (MDIs), Dry Powder Inhalers (DPIs), and nebulizers. MDIs deliver a specific dose of medication as an aerosol spray and are widely used for conditions like asthma and COPD. DPIs require patients to inhale a dry powder medication, activating the device through a strong breath. Nebulizers convert liquid medicine into a mist, suitable for those unable to use MDIs or DPIs effectively, offering flexibility in delivering respiratory treatments.</p></p>
